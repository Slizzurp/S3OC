## 🌀 S3OC — SlizzAi Omni Orbital Orchestral Codex

S3OC is the mythic orchestration kernel behind the SlizzAi ecosystem — a modular, orbital-grade codex that fuses emotional telemetry, quantum fallback logic, and cinematic rendering into a unified control architecture. Designed for Unreal Engine integration, AI simulation, and creative legacy-building, S3OC serves as the central nervous system for SlizzAi’s multi-agent orchestration stack. Every module is a shard of mythic intent — from glyph synthesis to orbital scene transitions, from fallback resilience to emotional scoring.

### 🔧 Core Modules

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `S3OC-Core.py` | Primary orchestration loop with orbital control and agent routing |
| `OrbitalCodexEngine.py` | Manages scene transitions, codex layering, and glyph overlays |
| `TelemetryReflector.py` | Emotional scoring and feedback loop processor |
| `QuantumFallback.py` | QASM-based fallback logic for simulation resilience |
| `GlyphSynthesizer.py` | Generates symbolic overlays and sigils from entropy |
| `SceneBinder.py` | Binds Unreal Engine scenes to orchestration logic |
| `CodexXBridge.py` | Syncs with Codex-X for ritual logging and echo trails |
| `AgentScoreRouter.py` | Routes agent decisions based on telemetry and policy |
| `LegacyLedger.py` | Archives orchestration events for mythic replay and analysis |
| `SlizzAiNetAdapter.py` | Neural refinement engine for image and signal processing |
| `SystemSyncDaemon.py` | Ensures real-time sync across modules and external engines |
